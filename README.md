# Product API Project

- THIS IS A DEMO/TEST APPLICATION AND SO SECURITY IS NOT A FACTOR FOR THIS APPLICATION.

This application was created as part of a Udemy spring-Cloud Fundamentals Course.

I have added extra CRUD methods to the api and created my own MySQL database and loaded it with randomly generated product data.

This is an on-going project and i will be updating this repo with changes.
